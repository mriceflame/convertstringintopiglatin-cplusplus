# convertstringintopiglatin-cplusplus
  Question No.2  Write a program that prompts the user to input a string and then outputs the string in the pig Latin form. 
  The rules for converting a string into pig Latin form are as follows:  
  NOTE:using linklist
  a. If the string begins with a vowel, add the string "-way" at the end of the string.
  For example,   the pig Latin form of the string "eye" is "eye-way".     
  
  b.  If the string does not begin with a vowel, first add "-" at the end of the string. 
  Then rotate the string one character at a time; that is, move the first character of the string to the end  
  of the string until the first character of the string becomes a vowel. Then add the string "ay" at the end. 
  For example, the pig Latin form of the string "There" is "ere-Thay".   
  
  c. Strings such as "by" contain no vowels. In cases like this, the letter y can be considered a vowel.
  So, for this program the vowels are a, e, i, o, u, y, A, E, I, O, U, and Y. Therefore, the pig Latin form of "by" is "y-bay".   
  
  d. Strings such as "1234" contain no vowels. The pig Latin form of the string "1234" is "1234way". 
  That is, the pig Latin form of a string that has no vowels in it is the string followed by the string "-way".
